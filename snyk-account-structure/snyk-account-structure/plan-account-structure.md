# Plan account structure

The way you structure your account determines other factors of your Snyk roll out. So itâ€™s important to consider how you want to align the organizations within your account before you start adding them.&#x20;

If you are using single sign-on, you'll also want a clear picture of how users will access organizations before you add users.

As a good practice, plan to align your organizations with how you want to allow permissions and access to projects. The way you set policies are the next order of consideration. And how you want to report on projects are the third most important consideration.



The hierarchy for your Snyk account includes a group at the highest level, organizations within that group, and projects within those organizations. Consider the hierarchy, as well as who needs access to specific projects, when determining how to align your Snyk organizations with your project structure.
